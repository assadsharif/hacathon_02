## Core Concepts {#core-concepts}

**Embodied Intelligence**: Intelligence that emerges from physical interaction with the environment, not just computation.

**Embodied Cognition**: Theory that cognitive processes are shaped by the body's interactions with the world.

**Sensorimotor Integration**: Coordination between sensory input and motor output.

**Physical Grounding**: Connecting abstract concepts to physical experiences.

**Morphological Computation**: Using body structure itself to simplify control problems.

## Perception {#perception}

**Proprioception**: Sensing body position and movement without visual input.

**Exteroception**: Sensing external environment (vision, touch, hearing).

**Multimodal Sensing**: Combining multiple sensor modalities for robust perception.

**Active Perception**: Moving to gather better sensory information.

**SLAM**: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping.

## Action & Control {#action-control}

**Degrees of Freedom (DoF)**: Number of independent movements a joint or system can make.

**Inverse Kinematics**: Computing joint angles to achieve desired end-effector position.

**Dynamics**: Forces and torques causing motion.

**Impedance Control**: Controlling relationship between force and motion.

**Whole-Body Control**: Coordinating all joints for unified behavior.

**Action-Perception Loop**: Continuous cycle of sensing, processing, and acting.

## Learning {#learning}

**Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Transferring policies trained in simulation to real robots.

**Domain Randomization**: Varying simulation parameters to improve transfer.

**Imitation Learning**: Learning from human demonstrations.

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Learning through trial and error with rewards.

**Motor Primitives**: Building blocks of complex movements.

## Humanoid Robotics {#humanoid}

**Bipedal Locomotion**: Walking on two legs.

**Zero Moment Point (ZMP)**: Balance criterion for walking robots.

**Underactuated Systems**: Systems with fewer actuators than DoF.

**Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: Study of interactions between humans and robots.

**Anthropomorphism**: Human-like characteristics in robots.
